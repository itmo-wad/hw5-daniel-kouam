localhost:5000 is the authentication page and it is linked to the database. Therefore the user should be created.
For the creation of a new user, you can register here : localhost:5000/register
After the user has been created, you can now connect via the login form : localhost:5000/
After the authentication, there is a redirection to the cabinet where the user can upload his image.
Finally the image can be accessed via : localhost:5000/upload/imagename.jpg
